Created a game using some simple random number logic.

The user must enter a name and random number between 1 and 25.

The logic gives the user a random goal to reach in only two attempts.

Initially the number entered is automatically updated with the number inputted multiplied by 10 and one attempt will remain for the user to win.

In the second attempt the updated score will added to a random number doubled. 

If the second attempt does not result in a number that is greater than the inital random goal, the player loses and the game is over.

Its a simple game based on luck and chance!

Only imports needed: Random and Scanner utilities.
